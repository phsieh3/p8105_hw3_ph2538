## Problem 1

### Loading and cleaning brfss data

``` r
#First, do some data cleaning:
#format the data to use appropriate variable names;
#focus on the “Overall Health” topic
#include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
#organize responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

#load brfss data
data(brfss_smart2010)

# #clean data
# clean_brfss = 
# brfss_smart2010 %>%
# janitor::clean_names() %>%
# filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
# filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor")
# 
#   
# brfss_smart2010$response_factor = factor(brfss_smart2010$response, levels = str_c(c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
# 
# clean_brfss
```
