## Problem 1

### Loading and cleaning brfss data

``` r
#First, do some data cleaning:
#format the data to use appropriate variable names;
#focus on the “Overall Health” topic
#include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
#organize responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

data(brfss_smart2010)

clean_brfss =
  brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") %>%
  select(year, locationdesc, response, data_value) %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response)) %>%
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>%
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = " - ")
```

### Question 1-4 for Problem 1

Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

1.  In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

2.  Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in
    each state from 2002 to 2010.

3.  Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean
    and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses
    across locations in NY State.

4.  For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each
    response category (taking the average across locations in a state).
    Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category
    separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over
    time.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

brfss_2002 = filter(clean_brfss, year == '2002') %>%

    locations.

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations.

The dimensions of the instacart dataset is1384617, 15, which means that
it has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Some key variables include
order ID, product ID, and user ID which are all integers. There is also
the product name, aisle, department, and department ID, which give
information on the products and where they are found.

### Questions for Problem 2

1.  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

2.  Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
    Order aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

3.  Make a table showing the most popular item aisles “baking
    ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”

4.  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7
table).

## Problem 3

### Questions for Problem 3

1.  For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?
2.  Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
    and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
    interpretable structure? Any outliers?
3.  Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
    (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make
    a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0
    and less than 100 separately by year.
